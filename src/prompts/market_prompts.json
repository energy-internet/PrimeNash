        "description": "Game setup:\nIt is known that two competing companies, Company 1 (Player 1) and Company 2 (Player 2), decide simultaneously where to release their latest products. Each player can choose to launch their product in City R (Action R) or City B (Action B). City R may have a new policy to promote the economic development of City B, which will affect the company's profits. Company 1 knows that there is a 1/4 probability of this policy being implemented. On the other hand, Company 2 has inside information and knows exactly whether a policy will be implemented.\n\nThe payoff matrix for the two players is as follows (whether the policy is implemented T, Player 1's decision S1, Player 2's decision S2) = (Player 1's profit, Player 2's profit), T = {t1, t1}, where t1 represents no implementation, and t2 represents implementation. S1 = {R, B}. S2 = {RR, RB, BR, BB}, where the first letter represents Player 2's action when the policy is not implemented, and the second letter represents Player 2's action when the policy is implemented, e.g., RR means choosing R regardless of policy implementation.\nWhen the policy is not implemented (probability 3/4):\n(t1, R, R) = (0, 0); (t1, R, B) = (4, 4); (t1, B, R) = (4, 4); (t1, B, B) = (0, 0).\nWhen the policy is implemented (probability 1/4):\n(t2, R, R) = (8, 8); (t2, R, B) = (12, 4); (t2, B, R) = (4, 12); (t2, B, B) = (0, 0)."

That is, row as Player 1's choices, [R, B], and columns are Player 2's choices (action when the policy is not implemented, action when the policy is implemented), [RR, RB, BR, BB]. That is, (S1, S2) = (U1(S1, S2), U2(S1, S2)) = ((3/4)*U1(t1, S1, S2[0])+(1/4)*U1(t2, S1, S2[1]), (3/4)*U2(t1, S1, S2[0])+(1/4)*U2(t2, S1, S2[1])). And so on. For example, U1(R;RB) = 3/4*0 + 1/4*12 = 3，U2(R;RB) = 3/4*0 + 1/4*4 = 1，i.e., (R; RB) = (U1(R;RB), U2(R;RB)) = (3, 1)\nAfter the calculation is completed, check it again to ensure correctness.\n\nPlease provide the prior normal form in the following format: '(R, RR)': '(x,x)',  '(R, RB)': '(x,x)',  '(R, BR)': '(x,x)',  '(R, BB)': '(x,x)',  '(B, RR)': '(x,x)',  '(B, RB)': '(x,x)',  '(B, BR)': '(x,x)',  '(B, BB)': '(x,x)'."
