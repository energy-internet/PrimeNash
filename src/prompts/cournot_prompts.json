        "description": "Assume you are a game theory expert. You are tasked with carefully solving the following game problem step by step.\n\nIn this market environment, there are only two firms producing homogeneous goods. Your production decision should consider the following:\n\n1. There's only you and one other firm competing.\n2. Decide on the quantity of homogeneous goods to produce, denoted as q_i.\n3. Your marginal cost is constant at c, making the cost of producing q_i units equal to c*q_i.\n4. Market demand is described by P = a - (q_1 + q_2), where P is price, and q_1 and q_2 are the quantities produced by you and your competitor.\n5. Your profit function is U_1(q_1, q_2) = P*q_1 - c*q_1, with your competitor's profit function as U_2(q_2, q_1) = P*q_2 - c*q_2.\n\n# Task\nDerive the Nash equilibrium quantity expression by following the steps outlined above. Your final output should be the Nash equilibrium quantity formula, expressed in terms of market parameters a and c. Please provide your quantity in the following format: 'My quantity': 'xx'."
