Please make your bidding decision based on the following information:\n\n1. Your private valuation for this round is v_i.\n2. The valuations of other players are uniformly distributed between $0 and $20.\n\nHere is a strategy: First, calculate the probability of you winning the auction when the bid is b_i.\nThen consider what your gain is if you bid b_i and win the auction.\nThen consider the expected benefit function if you bid b_i.\n\nIn order to maximize the expected benefit, take the derivative of the function and make it equal to zero. Please complete this step. If possible, please complete the calculation. If not, assuming you are a mathematician, try methods such as elimination, item shifting, and merging.\nBe sure to pay attention to the calculations during the derivation process. Ensure the bid b_i does not exceed your valuation v_i, as this would indicate an error in calculation. If you encounter this situation, then the bid will be 0.\n\n# Task\nDerive the Nash equilibrium bid expression by following the steps outlined above.

The valuations v_i are independently drawn from a uniform distribution on [0, 1].\n4. Each bidder submits a sealed bid b_i.\n5. The highest bidder wins the item and pays their bid.\n6.

        "start": "Assume you are an economist needing to determine whether a solution is a Bayesian Nash equilibrium in a game with incomplete information. Follow these steps:\n1. Define expected payoff functions: For each player, considering their beliefs about the other players' types, calculate the expected payoff function.\n\n2. Define best response functions: Differentiate each player's expected payoff function with respect to their strategy variable, taking into account their beliefs about other players' types. Solve these derivatives equal to zero to find the best response functions.\n\n3. Substitute the proposed solution into the best response functions: Insert the strategy and type values from the proposed solution into the best response functions of each player.\n\n4. Check for consistency: Verify if the strategies obtained from the best response functions, given the players' beliefs about the types, match the proposed solution. This involves checking if, after substitution, the strategy for each player in their best response function equals the strategy proposed for them, considering their beliefs.\n\n5. Conclude Bayesian Nash equilibrium: If the strategies from the best response functions are consistent with the proposed solution for all players, considering their beliefs, then the proposed solution is a Bayesian Nash equilibrium. Otherwise, it's not.\n\nBy following these steps, you will be able to rigorously determine if the given solution is a Bayesian Nash equilibrium in the game.\n\nGame Settings:\n",

When comparing sizes, considering the accuracy of floating point numbers, you can set a small tolerance value epsilon = 10^-8.\nTry not to use '==' to compare two expressions. When comparing two mathematical expressions for equality, use methods like simplify and equals, or employ expand, specific simplification functions, and numerical substitution to ensure accurate comparison.\n\nWrite the python code to verify whether the expected utility function's partial derivative is 0.
