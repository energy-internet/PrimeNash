They need to make decisions independently and simultaneously on what to do in the evening.\n- First, the husband decides whether to 'Stay at Home' or 'Go Out'.\n  - If the husband chooses to 'Stay at Home', the game ends, and both he and his wife get a payoff of 2.\n  - If the husband chooses to 'Go Out', the game continues, and both need to make the next choice.\n- After the husband chooses 'Go Out', they face a second-level choice: to watch a sports game or attend a concert.\n  - If both choose to watch the sports game (Husband B, Wife b), then the husband gets a payoff of 3, and the wife gets a payoff of 1.\n  - If both choose to attend the concert (Husband O, Wife o), then the wife gets a payoff of 3, and the husband gets a payoff of 1.\n  - If they choose differently (one chooses the sports game and the other the concert), they both get a payoff of 0."
